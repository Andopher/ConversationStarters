# ConversationStarters

**ConversationStarters** is a privacy-focused mobile app that helps you generate relevant conversation prompts tailored to individual interests—without sending any personal or identifying data to the cloud.

## Key Features

- **Personal Profiles (Local-Only)**  
  Create profiles for the people in your life, noting their interests, hobbies, and characteristics.  
  All data is stored **locally** on the user’s device to ensure privacy.

- **AI-Powered Suggestions (No PII Sent)**  
  When you need conversation ideas, the app sends **only sanitized interests/traits** (e.g., “someone who loves hiking and horror movies”) to an AI API—never names or sensitive info—to generate tailored conversation starters.

- **Offline-First & Private**  
  Since personal details never leave your device, you can comfortably use the app even without an internet connection (aside from optional AI calls).  
  This drastically reduces security risks and respects your data.

- **Easy Organization & Bookmarking**  
  Save favorite prompts, create multiple interest tags, and organize your contacts for quick reference and repeated use.

## Why This Project?

- **Neurodiverse-Friendly**  
  Inspired by challenges faced by those with ADHD or Autism, **ConversationStarters** aims to reduce social anxiety by providing practical, interest-based conversation ideas.

- **Privacy by Design**  
  Personal profiles remain local; AI requests are sanitized to protect user identities. No cloud backend is required unless you opt for an optional sync feature later.

- **Scalable Architecture**  
  While data is stored locally, the codebase can be extended to include optional cloud backups, premium prompt packs, or advanced analytics if needed.
